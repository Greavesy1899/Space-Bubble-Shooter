# Space Bubble Shooter
This game was built for the CGP2012M module. The goal was to build an engine which utilized OpenGL, and creaate a copy of the popular "Asteroid" game, but instead of asteroids, its bubbles. For this assignment, the base was the SDL-Snake game project, with OpenGL and a number of other features implemented. 

There were two parts to the assignment; the first part to develop a 2D engine using OpenGL, and then the latter part which was to convert it to a 3D engine with lighting.

This project wasn't as bug-free as the Snake game, and requires much more work for it to be feature-complete.
